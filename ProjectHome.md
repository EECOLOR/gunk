This project was created in order to get Guice style dependency injection in ActionScript 3 projects. It tries to mirror Guice's behavior and style whenever possible. Guice is a Java dependency injection framework developed by Google (see http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/Motivation?tm=6).

Not all features of Guice have been implemented in Gunk. Raise an issue if you want any feature to be included.

ActionScript 3 has quite a few limitations when it comes to annotations (or as most ActionScript programmers call it: metadata ). Another limitation is the lack of proper generics. Please check the wiki to find out more about the differences.

**Note that this project has not been tested in production yet**
