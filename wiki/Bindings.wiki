#summary Overview of bindings in Gunk (documentation taken from Guice)

= Bindings =

The injector's job is to assemble graphs of objects. You request an instance of a given type, and it figures out what to build, resolves dependencies, and wires everything together. To specify how dependencies are resolved, configure your injector with bindings. 

== Creating Bindings ==

To create bindings, extend {{{AbstractModule}}} and override its {{{configure}}} method. In the method body, call {{{bind()}}} to specify each binding. Once you've created your modules, pass them as arguments to {{{Gunk.createInjector()}}} to build an injector. 

Use modules to create [Linked_bindings linked bindings], [Instance_bindings instance bindings], [Provides_methods Provides methods], [Provider_bindings provider bindings] and [Untargetted_bindings untargetted bindings].

== More Bindings ==

In addition to the bindings you specify, the injector includes built-in bindings. When a dependency is requested but not found it attempts to create a just-in-time binding. The injector also includes bindings for the providers of its other bindings.
