= Scopes =

By default, Gunk returns a new instance each time it supplies a value. This behavior is configurable via scopes. Scopes allow you to reuse instances: Gunk provides one for the lifetime of an application, the Singleton scope.

Applying Scopes

Gunk comes with a Singleton annotation.

{{{
[Singleton]
public class InMemoryTransactionLog implements ITransactionLog 
{
}

Scopes can also be configured in bind statements: 

{{{
  bind(ITransactionLog).to(InMemoryTransactionLog).inScope(Scopes.SINGLETON);
}}}
